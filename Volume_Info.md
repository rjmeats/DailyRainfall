# DRain Volumes Archive

*These notes and associated spreadsheet are based on the Met Office's [Daily Rainfall 'DRain' archive](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) contents as of 
mid-August 2025. At this point, the Met Office had not yet released one DRain volume, containing the Scotland records for 1870.* 

At a high-level, the archive is divided into 'England & Wales' and 'Scotland' sub-divisions, which are then sub-divided into decade-based folders containing the actual PDF volumes. Some of the volumes are given a 
short description in the archive. Volume names include the range of years covered by the volume, and some sort of indicator of the set of rainfall stations covered - this is usually county based or 
station number based. Some volume names include a part number (1, 2 or 3) or an alphabetical range indicator (e.g. A-H) where the records for a large
county have been split over multiple PDF file volumes.

PDF Volume sizes range from 2 pages to over 1000, typically a few hundred pages and a few 10s of megabytes. 

Summary of PDF volume counts:

|Division|Volume count|Combined pages|
|:-------|------------|--------------|
|England & Wales|875|310,724|
|Scotland|209|77,426|
|Total|1084|388,150|

This spreadsheet lists all the volumes in the DRain archive: [DRain_Volumes.xlsx](DRain_Volumes.xlsx). 

Impressions from inspecting sample DRain volumes are that in the main they consist of annual daily rainfall forms for a particular station, usually on the standard British Rainfall form of the time,
but there are various other forms and items in the volumes too, for example:

* daily rainfall forms covering a single month
* monthly rainfall forms for a year
* notes and letters
* table of contents pages
* annual daily rainfall forms used to report non-daily rainfall (e.g. weekly, monthly)

These sample inspections also show some differences in the organisation and contents of the 'Scotland' volumes compared to the 'England & Wales' volumes, as outlined in general terms below.

## 'England & Wales' volumes

(This Met Office sub-division also includes records from the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.)

* each volume covers a decade (more for the pre-1860 and 1950-1962 volumes), and so can contain multiple annual forms from a particular station
* volumes up to the 1920s are county-based, from the 1930s onwards they are based on British Rainfall station number ranges
* the first page(s) in a volume usually show a contents list of the stations/years present in the volume
* detailed records follow the contents list, ordered by station name (or number) and then year 
* the first annual form for each station within a volume usually has a small label attached to it, naming the station and listing its years, as a sort of chapter heading
	* this form is imaged twice on consecutive pages, first with the label displayed, and then again with the label raised or detached
	* as a result, up to 10% of the annual form images in the volume are essentially duplicates, other than in the label position
* records go up to 1962 rather than 1960

## 'Scotland' volumes

* volumes contain records for a particular single year rather than for a decade
* there is a single 'all counties' volume per year up until 1921, covering the whole of Scotland
* from 1922 to 1924 there are two volumes per year
* from 1925 onwards there are 4 volumes per year, two covering Wigtown to Argyll, two covering Clackmannan to Shetland
* the county ordering within a volume is the same as used for the Scottish counties within British Rainfall
* in the volumes up to 1903, about 80% of the pages are for *monthly* forms of daily rainfall rather than annual forms
    * the monthly forms have fields for daily and monthly remarks, which are often populated
	* the monthly forms are sometimes damaged or badly stained
	* from 1904 onwards, the monthly forms are no longer included in the volumes (and the page count of the volumes drops accordingly) 
	* the volume may or may not contain an annual form containing the combined monthly form values for a particular station for the year
* normally there are no labels attached to the forms, and so forms are not double-imaged
* from the 1920s, images quite often show the rear side of the annual form, which contains monthly rainfall figures for a year (and some metadata) rather than daily figures
* there are a few volumes not covered by the above:
	* 1925 and 1926 each have an additional volume of records just from lighthouses
	* the DRain_1911_1915_All_Counties covers 5 years and contains monthly records for additional (?) stations reporting to the Met Office (rather than British Rainfall, then still a separate organisation)
* volumes cover the years 1864 to 1960, apart from 1868 which has no records (and 1870, not yet available in the archive)

## Ireland

There are no volumes of daily rainfall records for any part of Ireland in the DRain archive.
