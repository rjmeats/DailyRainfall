# DRain Volumes Archive

*These notes and associated spreadsheet are based on the Met Office's [Daily Rainfall 'DRain' archive](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) contents as of 
mid-August 2025. At this point, the Met Office had not yet released one DRain volume, containing the Scotland records for 1870.* 

At a high-level, the archive is divided into 'England & Wales' and 'Scotland' sub-divisions, which are then sub-divided into decade-based folders containing the actual PDF volumes. Some of the volumes are given a 
short description in the archive. Volume names include the range of years covered by the volume, and some sort of indicator of the set of rainfall stations covered - this is usually county based or 
station number based. Some volume names include a part number (1, 2 or 3) or an alphabetical range indicator (e.g. A-H) where the records for a large
county have been split over multiple PDF file volumes.

PDF Volume sizes range from 2 pages to over 1000, typically a few hundred pages and a few 10s of megabytes. 

Summary of PDF volume counts:

|Division|Volume count|Combined pages|
|:-------|------------|--------------|
|England & Wales|875|310,724|
|Scotland|209|77,426|
|Total|1084|388,150|

This spreadsheet lists all the volumes in the DRain archive: [DRain_Volumes.xlsx](DRain_Volumes.xlsx). 

Impressions from inspecting sample DRain volumes are that in the main they consist of annual daily rainfall forms for a particular station, but there are various other forms and items in
the volumes too, for example:

* daily rainfall forms covering a single month
* monthly rainfall forms for a year
* notes and letters
* table of contents pages
* annual daily rainfall forms used to report non-daily rainfall (e.g. weekly, monthly)

These sample inspections also show some differences in the organisation and contents of the 'Scotland' volumes compared to the 'England & Wales' volumes.

## 'England & Wales' volumes

* this sub-division also includes the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands
* each volume covers a decade or more, and so can contain multiple annual forms for a particular station
* volumes usually begin with a contents list showing the stations/years present in the volume
* .. followed by the detailed records ordered by station name (station number from the 1930s) and then year
* the first annual form for a station within a volume usually has a small label attached to it naming the station and listing its years
* .. this form is imaged twice on consecutive pages, once with the label displayed, and then again with the label raised or detached
* .. as a result, up to 10% of the annual form images are duplicates, other than in the label position
* volumes up to the 1920s are county-based, from the 1930s onwards they are based on British Rainfall station number ranges 
* records go up to 1962

## 'Scotland' volumes

* volumes contain records for a single year


## Ireland

There are no volumes of daily rainfall records for any part of Ireland in the DRain archive.
