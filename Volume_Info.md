# DRain Volumes Archive

* * based on the Met Office's [Daily Rainfall 'DRain' archive]([Daily Rainfall 'DRain' volumes](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) contents as of mid-August 2025.*
* * at this point, the Met Office had not yet released one DRain volume, containing the Scotland records for 1870.* 

At a high-level, the archive is divided into 'England & Wales' and 'Scotland' sub-divisions, which are then sub-divided into decade-based folders containing the actual PDF volumes. Some of the volumes are given a 
short description in the archive. PDF Volume sizes range from 2 pages to over 1000, typically a few hundred pages and a few 10s of megabytes. Volume names include the range of years covered by the volume, and some sort of indicator of the set 
of rainfall stations covered - this is usually county based or station number based. Some volume names include a part number (1, 2 or 3) or an alphabetical range indicator (e.g. A-H) where the records for a large
county have been split over multiple PDF file volumes.

Summary of PDF volumes counts:

|Division|Volume count|Combined pages|
|--------|------------|--------------|
|England & Wales|875|310,724|
|Scotland|209|77,426|
|Total|1084|388,150|
