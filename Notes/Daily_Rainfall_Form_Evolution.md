# Evolution of the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall Form - Overview

Notes on how British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall form has evolved over time. The basic form layout is 
* a main grid of 12 monthly columns x 31 daily rows + one or more rows for monthly aggregates
* form headings and station metadata above the grid
* there can also be instructions above the grid or to the side of it.
* later on, the sections for detailed metadata and instructions moved to the back of the form

These notes are based on samples from the ['DRain' PDF volumes](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) of scanned daily rainfall forms recently added to the Met Office 
Online Archive, supplemented by some material in British Rainfall annuals and similar publications.
