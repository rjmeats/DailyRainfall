# Evolution of the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall Form

Notes on how British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall form has evolved over time. The basic form layout is: 
* a main grid of 12 monthly columns x 31 daily rows and then one or more further rows for monthly aggregates
* form headings and station metadata above the grid
* there can also be instructions above the grid or to the side of it
* a small footer section, for footnotes and 'Printing codes'
* later on, the sections for detailed metadata and instructions moved to the back of the form

These notes are based on samples from the ['DRain Volumes'](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) of scanned Daily Rainfall 
forms recently added to the Met Office Online Archive. Changes to the form often tied in with events and discussions with the British Rainfall Organization, and so the notes also
include some related material taken from [*British Rainfall annual volumes*](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_29627928-7fb1-43b2-b7ad-f63509127917) and similar publications available online.

* [Part 1](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution_part_1.md) covers the period up to 1923, when the Daily Rainfall form changed from single-sided to double-sided
* [Part 2](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution_part_2.md) covers the period from 1924 onwards 

[Gallery of Daily Rainfall Forms](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Gallery.md) displays an example of each Daily Rainfall form version in time order.

The forms in scope of this note are the Daily Rainfall forms covering a full year. The DRain Volumes also include some daily forms which only covered a single month; examples of these and some 
other standard form in the DRain Volumes are shown in a separate [Other Forms](Other_DRain_Forms.md) note.
