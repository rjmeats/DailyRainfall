# Evolution of the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall Form

Notes on how British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall form evolved over time. The notes are based on samples from 
the ['DRain Volumes'](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) of scanned Daily Rainfall forms recently added 
to the Met Office Online Archive. 

* [Overview](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution.md) - this note
* [Part 1](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution_part_1.md) covers the period up to 1923, when the daily rainfall form changed from single-sided to double-sided
* [Part 2](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution_part_2.md) covers the period from 1924 to 1962, when the Met Office's scanned DRain volumes end 

## Scope

The forms in scope of these notes are the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall forms covering a full year. The DRain Volumes also include some daily forms which only 
covered a single month; examples of these and some other standard forms in the DRain Volumes are shown in a separate [Other Forms](Other_DRain_Forms.md) note.

The period covered is late 1860s, when the first Daily Rainfall form recognisable as being produced by George Symons appears in the DRain archive, to 1962, the final year of the DRain archive contents.
1860s-1962.

## Related material

Changes to the form often tie in with events and discussions within the British Rainfall Organization and later the Met Office, and sometimes the wider world, so the notes also 
include some related material taken from [*British Rainfall annual volumes*](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_29627928-7fb1-43b2-b7ad-f63509127917), 
[*Met Office Annual Reports*](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_e75e4cf3-9be6-47f9-9444-0c2debbcef83), and similar publications available online.

## Basic form layout

The basic Daily Rainfall form layout is: 

* a main grid of 12 monthly columns x 31 daily rows and then one or more further rows for monthly aggregates
* form headings and station metadata above the grid
* there can also be instructions above the grid or to the side of it
* a small footer section, for footnotes and 'Printing codes'
* later on, the sections for detailed metadata and instructions moved to the back of the form

## Form version identifiers and 'Printing codes'

The were changes to the Daily Rainfall form nearly every year. In the absence of anything better, these notes use elements the 'Printing code' present in the footer of nearly 
every version of the form as the basis for a version identifier. Although no reference document has been found to explain the full meaning of any of the Printing codes, by 
inspection they can be seen to always contain a month and year value, and up to 1950 there was also a number that seems to be a print-run size. 

For early forms, the entire Printing code is used as the version identifier. After the British Rainfall Organization became part of the Met Office within the
Air Ministry, Printing codes became much longer and more obscure, and so a version identifier just based on the month/year/print-run parts is used.

Example early Printing code "K-1000/12/70" from December 1870, used directly as the version identifier :

Example Met Office period Printing code from October 1919, producing version identifier "7500 10/19" : 

<img src="page_images/7500_10_19.printing_code.jpg" style="width:500px">

In the few cases where a version of the Daily Rainfall form does not have a Printing code, a descriptive alternative has been assigned as the version identifier.

The 'Printing code year' and the year of the observations entered on the form are not always closely related. It is quite common to see forms with a Printing code year several
years earlier than the observations, where a form has not been used until several years after being printed. Less common but still seen are cases where the observations are from a year
which is significantly earlier than the Printing code year; in these cases, the forms must be showing re-transcribed (and possibly corrected) figures from an earlier source.
