# Evolution of the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall Form

* [Overview](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution.md) 
* [Part 1](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution_part_1.md) covers the period up to 1923, when the daily rainfall form changed from single-sided to double-sided
* **Part 2** - this note - covers the period from 1924 onwards 

## Use of both sides of the Daily Rainfall form
Up to 1923, British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall form was single-sided, with the back of the form left blank. From 1924 onwards, the form became two-sided, with the front side continuing
to be used for the main 12x31 daily grid. For 1924 and early 1925, the back was used just for an expanded set of instructions and an area for observer notes, and information about the printer, including the Printing code. 
From late 1925 onwards, the form was divided into 4 sections A, B, C, and D, with the front being section A, the main daily form, and the back used for section B (monthly figures), section C (metadata) and section D (instructions), as
well as the printer information and Printing code.

In the tables below which summarise changes between versions of the form, [A], [B], [C], and [D] are used to identify the section of the form related to a particular change.

### Practicalities of following double-sided form evolution

The use of both sides of the form has a few implications for the process used here for following and recording the evolution of the daily rainfall form over time, particularly as only the online scanned 
forms are being used (rather than direct inspection of the actual forms in person):

* the front and back of the form both evolve over time, and so are both covered in the sections which follow below
* as the Printing code for the forms is only given on the back of the form, this makes assigning a version number to the front reliant on making a pairing to its back
* often the online archive just contains an image for either the front or the back of a particular sheet, not both, so determining a matching front and back pair for each version of the form takes some trawling of the archive volumes
* for some reason, the Scottish volumes of the archive more often have paired front and back images of the same sheet, so many of the examples to follow are from Scottish sites
* finding front and back pairings for the less common millimetre-based form variants is particularly tricky; these are mostly ignored in the rest of this note

## 1924-1930 Daily Rainfall Forms

The table below lists versions of the form in use in the 1924-1930 period, as determined from the rainfall records in various Daily Rainfall volumes in the Met Office archive.
The table also outlines notable changes to the form layout over time, with some of these changes covered in more detail following the table. 

|Version|Links|Notes|
|:------|:----|:----|
|10000&nbsp;12/24|[Front](page_images/DRain_1924_All_Counties_Part1_p0141.jpg)&nbsp;:&nbsp;[Back](page_images/DRain_1924_All_Counties_Part1_p0142.jpg)|The first double-sided form. 'For Official Use' added to the top of the page (but not always?). Extra metadata fields in top right for 'County No.', 'River Dist.' and 'Station No.'. 'Previous Day' instructions simplified and highlighting changed and 'Rules for Rainfall Observers' section removed, leading to a reduced size Instructions section at the top. No page footer content. Back of the form contains extensive instructions and an area for Observer notes. Detailed HMSO purchasing info on the back, and the name and address of the printer. Printing code is at the bottom of the back of the form.|

This version seems to be just a small print run repeat of "10000&nbsp;12/24".|

Section A is the normal daily 12x31 form with a few minor changes. [A] Metadata fields moved to the left of the header and reduced in number. [A] right of the header used to point Observers to the back of the form. [A] "Year's Total" cell heading spread over two lines. [A] Signature section added to footer, and 'PTO'. Section B 'Monthly Summary' is a new section, with its own grid of monthly values. New section C 'Particulars of Station' has station metadata, some of which used to be on the front of the old form, but mostly is new information. [C] also has a space for recording 'exceptional rainfall for the year', replacing the 'Notes' area on the back of the previous form. New Section D provides detailed instructions for observers; the instructions themselves are very similar to those provided in the previous version of the form, but are presented in two columns. The HMSO and printer information is presented beneath section D, using less space than previously, followed by the Printing code. The price quoted is now '1d' rather than '2d'.

### First two-sided form - "10000&nbsp;12/24"

The "10000&nbsp;12/24" version of the form makes use of the back of the form for the first time. The back of the form is used for:

* expanded instructions, replacing the need for Observers to refer to the separate 'Rules for Rainfall Observers' publication
* a 'Notes' area for the Observer to record details of exceptional rainfall or to pass on details of potential new Observers.
* details of HMSO addresses where the form could be purchased, and price
* name and address of the printer
* the Printing code

A couple of changes to the front of the form tie in with this:
* the instructions in the header of the front of the form are reduced to just the 'previous day' aspect, with this now given extra emphasis
* the footer is blank, the Printing code only appears on the back of the form

### A, B, C, and D Sections introduced - "11,500&nbsp;12/25"

The "11,500&nbsp;12/25" version of the form splits the Daily Rainfall into 4 sections, 2 of which have content not previously included on the form. The sections are labelled A, B, C and D, with section A being on the
front of the form, and B, C, and D being on the back. Each section is identified by a large boxed capital letter along with the section title.

#### Section A for the entry of Daily Observations

Section A forms the front of the Daily Rainfall form, and presents the standard 12x31 daily rainfall grid with totals, basic station metadata and form titles.

</a>

#### Section B - Monthly Summary

Section B appears as a long thin area in the top-left part of the back of the form. It allows monthly rainfall data to be recorded for stations which do not report daily rainfall. There is a 
separate monthly rainfall form *Form 1093* which this section is modelled on. Generally, an Observer was expected to fill in Section A or Section B, although some did both.

#### Section C - Particulars of Station

Section C is used for recording various station and rain gauge metadata, going beyond what used to be recorded on the front of the form. Additional items recorded include:
* the correspondence name and address of observer
* station location relative to the nearest parish church and railway station
* details of any move made by the gauge during the past year
* details of objects near to the gauge
* via a diagram, the style of gauge being used

Some of these station details at least must have been already recorded by the British Rainfall Organization:
* presumably names and addresses
* the 10-year rainfall sheets from the 1900s and before include details of locations relative to church/railway and nearby objects

So it's possible Section C is based on some pre-existing form type, perhaps held elsewhere (offline?) in the Met Office archives.

Section C also includes an area for recording details of exceptional rainfall during the year.

</a>

#### Section D - Instructions

Section D contains instructions for Observers, very similar to the instructions provided on the back of the previous version of the form, except formatted into two columns, and with some text in italics
to indicate that it applies to both Section A and Section B.
