# Daily Rainfall Form Evolution - Miscellaneous

Some additional details and summaries relating to the [Evolution of the British Rainfall Organization's Daily Rainfall Form](Daily_Rainfall_Form_Evolution.md) notes.

Year numbers shown below relate to the year given in the Printing codes on the first version of the Daily Rainfall form to show a particular feature.

## Number of form versions identified

Examining samples of the DRain archive volumes has identified that almost 100 different 'inches' versions of the Daily Rainfall form were printed over the late 1860s-1962 period, 
as well as more than 20 millimetre versions of the form from 1919 onwards.

| |Inches|Millimetres|Total|
|-|------|-----------|-----|
|**Single-sided**|60|5|65|
|**Double-sided**|35|19|54|
|**Total**|95|24|119|

There may be a few more versions to be discovered, for example no version for 1880 was found in the samples.

## Print-run size over time

Nearly all Daily Rainfall forms have a 'Printing code' in a footer, which by inspection seem to contain a month/year of printing and 
until 1950, a print-run size. Extracting the year and print-run size and plotting them shows how the number of forms printed varied over time:

</a>

If the values extracted from the Printing code really are print-run sizes, it looks like there was a lot of stockpiling of forms in the years just before the Second World War.

Adding up these print-run sizes produces a total around 600,000 Daily Rainfall forms printed up to 1950. This compares to about 360,000 images in the combined DRain volumes, although
that number contains forms from 1951-1962 (and a few very early ones), does not contain any Irish stations or records for Scotland before 1922, not all images are of Daily Rainfall forms, and some forms 
appear twice, as separate front and back images. So very roughly, perhaps around half of the printed forms ended up being used, returned and stored in the Met Office archives.

## Major form layout changes

## Major organisational changes

|1957|British Rainfall Organization becomes part of the larger Met Office 'British Rainfall and Hydrology' department|

## Addresses

Every version of the Daily Rainfall form has at least one address for the British Rainfall Organization and/or Met Office. In some cases the address was presented 
as being the address to return the completed form to, in others as the address to apply to for a copy of the 'Rules for Rainfall Observers' pamphlet or similar. Initially
a single address is given on the form, but during the Met Office period an Edinburgh address and later a Belfast address were also added.

Changes to the addresses shown on the form were as follows:

## Printers

The first time the Daily Rainfall form names the printer of the forms is in the 1906 version. The map-maker and retailer [Edward Stanford](https://www.stanfords.co.uk/our-history) is named on forms from 1870-1908 and in a few more cases
up to 1915, but is never identified as being the printer:
* from 1870 to 1882 'Mr Stanford' is named as a source of additional copies of the form, in the vertical column of text on the left of the Form
* from 1883 to 1908, and also 1912 and 1915, 'Edward Stanford' and a Charing Cross or Long Acre address appears in the footer of the form, but with no explicit role given
* from 1906 to 1915, those versions of the form which show 'Edward Stanford' in the footer also identify the printer as [Waterlow and Sons Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterlow_and_Sons), London Wall

British Rainfall annuals also showed 'Edward Stanford' and an address near the bottom of its title pages from 1861 to 1918, and identified the printer as 'G.Shield' and later as 'Shield and Spring' - initially 
at 30, Lower Sloane Street and then at other nearby addresses. So G.Shield is a candidate for being the printer of the early versions of the Daily Rainfall form, but this is only speculation.

After the British Rainfall Organization became part of the Met Office and Air Ministry, its forms and publications come under HMSO - there is no further mention of Edward Stanford:
* the 1919 to 1923 versions of the form (still single-sided) do not name the printer, but include likely printer name abbreviations in the Printing code:
  * "A.&E.W."  - possibly Waterlows again, but not sure what the other initials are
  * "T.S." - probably Jas. Truscott & Son Ltd
* the double-sided versions of the form generally identify the printer in full on the back near the bottom, using wording similar to 'Printed under the authority of HMSO by ...'
* for 1942-1949 the printer was not named on the form, but the Printing code included an identifiable abbreviation "W.H.&S." - William Hobbs & Sons Ltd
