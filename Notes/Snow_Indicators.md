# Snow Indicators on Daily Rainfall Forms

This note provides examples of the ways observers have indicated snow-based amounts on the Daily Rainfall form, based on samples from a few of 
the ['DRain' PDF volumes](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_9903efdf-7f99-4cae-a723-8b3f426eea20) scanned rainfall sheets in the Met Office Online Archive. 

The note also shows how the instructions for handling snow in relation to daily rainfall reporting changed over time, based on instructions on the Daily Rainfall sheet and articles in
[*British Rainfall annuals*](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_29627928-7fb1-43b2-b7ad-f63509127917).

## Overview

Measurement and reporting of snowfall on the Daily Rainfall forms is a recurring topic in the early years of the British Rainfall Organization. The underlying aim was to 
report snowfall as an equivalent amount of (melted) rainfall. This had two aspects:

* how to report this figure on the Daily Rainfall form
* how best to measure this amount - this was a subject of considerable experiment and debate, and various options were set out in instructions 
for observers over time

After a long period where the handling of snowfall had no further changes, the Daily Rainfall form introduced additional snow handling instructions 
in the mid-1950s, probably as a result of the Met Office taking over the work of the Snow Survey of Great Britain. This aspect is dealt with in a separate
section below.

## Instructions for indicating snow-based figures

Only the first decade or so of Daily Rainfall forms provided explicit instructions about how to indicate snow-based figures (in the 'Condensed Instructions'
section at the top of the form just above the main grid). The instructions simply said to prefix an 'S' to the measured amount of melted snow. 

The original '136 Camden Square' version of the form from the late 1860s illustrates this:

<img src="snow_images/1869.no_rain_instruction.jpg" style="width:800px">

This wording for indicating rainfall measurements derived from snow remained in place until 1878, apart from being absent for one year in 1875. 

From 1879, the Daily Rainfall form changed to refer observers to a separate pamphlet of instructions rather than presenting them on the form. This pamphlet was reproduced 
at the end of British Rainfall 1880. Section XV of the pamphlet lists ways for measuring the rainfall equivalent of snow (see later section) but gives no instructions about how to 
indicate snow on the form.

From then on until the mid-1950s (see later section), there seems to be no further explicit instruction given to observers about how to indicate snow-based rainfall measurements 
on the Daily Rainfall form.

## Actual indicator usage

Although the instruction to early observers was to prefix an 'S' for snow-based rainfall measurements, in practice observers represented snow in a variety of ways, including:
* a prefixed 'S', as requested
* an 'S' after the amount (which can sometimes look like a '5' digit)
* an 'S' as a superscript after the amount
* the full word 'Snow' next to the amount

Observers continued to use these indications long after the last explicit instruction to prefix an 'S' in 1878.

## Instructions for measuring snow as rainfall

The Daily Rainfall form had brief instructions for how to convert snowfall into a rainfall amount up to 1878. After that, instructions were moved from the form into
a separate pamphlet, which included more detailed guidance on handling snow. In parallel with this, snow-handling was discussed in various early editions of *British Rainfall*

From the mid-1920s, some instructions appeared on the Daily Rainfall form again, now on the back, but these did not cover snow aspects.

<a id="instructions-on-the-daily-rainfall-form"></a>

### Instructions on the Daily Rainfall form

The initial '136 Camden Square' version of the form said to melt the collected snow or to convert the average depth of snow to a rainfall amount by dividing by 12:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1861-1870_Leicestershire_p6.instructions.jpg" style="width:800px">

The 1872 version of the form introduced an easier-to-calculate example of the '12 inches of snow = 1 inch of rain' approximation:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1871-1880_Cambridgeshire_p20.instructions.jpg" style="width:800px">

The 1875 form suggested using a known amount of warm water to melt the snow:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1871-1880_Cambridgeshire_p67.instructions.jpg" style="width:800px">

The 1876 form went back to the previous wording:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1871-1880_Cambridgeshire_p100.instructions.jpg" style="width:800px">

From 1879 onwards, the detailed snow and other instructions on the form were replaced by a reference to a pamphlet:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1871-1880_Cambridgeshire_p6.instructions.jpg" style="width:800px">

When the Daily Rainfall form became two-sided in 1924, the instructions on the back did not give any guidance on snow handling until 1955 (see later section).

<a id="pamphlet-and-similar-instructions"></a>

### Pamphlet and similar instructions

The Met Office Online Archive does not seem to contain any of the various 'Rules for Rainfall Observer' and similar pamphlets issued by the British Rainfall Organisation over time. However parts of
them, including the rules, were sometimes printed in annual *British Rainfall* editions. And editions of *British Rainfall* before the first pamphlet (~1878) also listed similar rules.

The extracts below show a few sample snapshots of the snow rules (often appearing as Rule XV and later as Rule 13):

British Rainfall 1864 p12:

<img src="snow_images/BR_1864.snow_instructions.adj.jpg" style="width:500px">

British Rainfall 1871 p162:

<img src="snow_images/BR_1871.snow_instructions.adj.jpg" style="width:500px">

British Rainfall 1875 added a warning to the rule section (3) that the 'divide snow depth by 12' approach was very approximate, and only to be used as a last resort. British Rainfall 1876 added a 
further note at the end of the snow rules to day that Snowdon gauges were the best to use for snow. The text used in British Rainfall 1876 for Rule XV is that used in the original version of the pamphlet:

<img src="snow_images/BR_1876.snow_instructions.adj.jpg" style="width:500px">

The instructions pamphlet, including the snow section, was revised in the early 1900s, with the final snapshot being provided in British Rainfall 1908 p304:

<img src="snow_images/BR_1908.snow_instructions.adj.jpg" style="width:500px">

<a id="1950s-instructions"></a>

## 1950s Instructions

The 1955 version of the Daily Rainfall form introduced a new instruction on the back relating to snow recording:

<img src="snow_images/DRain_1959_Wigtown_To_Argyll_Part1_p198.instructions.jpg" style="width:500px">

and also added a space for recording 'Notes on Snowfall'. 

British Rainfall 1953 (published in 1955) says that the Met Office had taken over the 'Snow Survey of Great Britain' from the British
Glaciological Society', which may be a reason for the appearance of these new snow instructions.

A quick search of late 1950s Daily Rainfall forms didn't find much actual usage relating to these instructions, but here are examples:

* provision of the requested 'a', 'b', 'c' values:

	<img src="snow_images/DRain_1960_Clackmannan_To_Shetland_Part1_p17.abc.jpg" style="width:300px">

* 'Notes on snowfall' filled in:

	<img src="snow_images/DRain_1960_Wigtown_to_Argyll_Part1_p144.snow_notes.jpg" style="width:400px">

<a id="some-snow-articles-in-british-rainfall"></a>

## Some snow articles in British Rainfall

Snow measurement was debated quite often in the early volumes of *British Rainfall*.

* 'The Measurement of Snow' in British Rainfall 1888 references and reviews many early discussions and articles 
* Colonel Ward's 'On the Measurement of Snow' in British Rainfall 1874, with updates in subsequent years, led to Symons recommending the use of
the 'Snowdon' type rain gauge, with its funnel set down in the tube to allow snow to collect. Ward's report also highlighted how approximate the '12 inches of
snow = 1 inch of rainfall' was, with the actual factor varying enormously depending on the density of the snow.

Several articles describe in detail snowfall events. These don't directly relate to Daily Rainfall recording or measurement instructions, but a couple to mention are:

* 'The Christmas Snow Storm of 1906' in British Rainfall 1906 describes how the British Rainfall Organization interrupted its Christmas break to set up a detailed country-wide survey
of the heavy snow which fell on 25th-26th December 1906. 
* 'Snowfall in The British Isles during the half-century 1876-1925' in British Rainfall 1927 by L.C.W. Bonacina with decadal follow-ups in British Rainfall 1936, 1948 and 1955.
